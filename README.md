WorldGM
=======

Allows you to set different gamemodes for different worlds in your Pocketmine server! This plugin is very useful to Multi-Gamemode servers
and could be an essential plugin for your server

This plugin automatically changes a player's Gamemode to what you set the WorldGamemode shall be, except for the players who are whitelisted for No-Gamemode change.

It is very simple to use! All you have to do is run a command and sit back & Relax!


Plugin forked from tschrock's PerWorldGamemode
